This is a widget to display a calendar as a popup - sort of.  It has a
GtkEntry in which the date can be entered, but also a button to display
a calendar that can be use in a point-and-click fashion.  It pops up in
a GtkDialog, and when closed, the date is put into the GtkEntry.

The popup calendar additionally has convenience buttons where you can
jump forward or backward by either 6 months or 5 years.

This widget is Gobject-Introspection compatible, which means that this
object can be implemented in numerous programming languages.  Languages
tested are Perl and Python.
